# what this dir is for

this dir hosts all the files that contain text content for the storefront.

In other words: they host text content and translations of type `string`

Default is english
-> refer to `en.default.json`

As opposed to hard-coded text-strings in sections, text-strings provided in these `.json` files provide standardized text that can be accessed thoughout the theme by merchants (using the web editor) and theme developers (using the object notation) alike. 

the object and the reference to the objects in the `.json` files here are type-safe. So there must be TS working in the background.
-> refer to:

--> on individal *section* pages 

```js
{{ 'templates.404.emotion' | t }} 
```
any changes to the type here will cause type errors

--> on *locales* files

```js
    "404": {
      "title": "Page not found",
      "emotion": "ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±",
      "subtext": "404"
    }
```
any value other than that of type `string` will throw a `TypeError`.
